# Running The Project

1. Run the server code and make sure that the server is running on local host machine.
2. Run the client code.
3. You can interact with the server through the client with (add; xyz, list;, and remov; xyz)

{% hint style="info" %}
You can run multiple clients to interact with the same server, knowing that all the clients are indeed separated and each thread is running individually.
{% endhint %}

4. If you have multiple clients you can retrieve only what client added as other clients do not have share resources.
